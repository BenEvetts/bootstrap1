      <h1>Making a Webpage</h1>
      <h2>Where To Start</h2>
        <p>Making Websites can be <strong>easy!</strong> You just need to know the basic rules and guidelines then it should be a <em>breeze</em>.<br><br>Here's a beginner's list to each types of code that you will be using.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML - HTML serves the purpose of being the main <em>structure</em> of text, therefore this is allowing me to type this paragraph so that you are able to read and learn... kinda like Inception, isn't it? This will be the latest version which is HTML5</li>
          <li>CSS - For all those fancy people out there! Learning CSS will be key to making font very pretty!</li>
          <li>Responsive Design - <!-- W.I.P -->   </li>
          <li>JavaScript - The cogs of a watch. The gears of a machine. Java has been the key source of giving a webpage it's <em>functionality</em></li>
          <li>GIT - <!-- W.I.P -->   </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lessons to each of these styles can be found on multiple websites like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> or <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a>. I would recommend Code Acadamy as it provides a helpful step by step guide on each of the styles of code listed, while explaining different phrases used in the style.</p>
